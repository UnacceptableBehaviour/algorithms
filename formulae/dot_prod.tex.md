### Problem 1-3. [16 points] Peak-Finding Correctness 
### Problem 1-4. [16 points] Peak-Finding Efficiency 
	Look at 4 alorithms in algorithms.py 
	Assess correctness, efficiency
### Problem 1-5. [19 points] Peak-Finding Proof 
	proof for one of the algorithms
### Problem 1-6. [19 points] Peak-Finding Counterexamples 	data that shows how the python algorithms can fail

\begin{equation}
  D_1.D_2\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{w}D_1[w].D_2[w]
  \label{sum}  
\end{equation}

Some other ideas once you take the flowers off its crab wrapped in cucmber jelly
sat on vac packed watermelon . .  . looks nice though eh!?
